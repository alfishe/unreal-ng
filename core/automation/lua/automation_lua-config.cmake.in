automation_lua-config.cmake.in
------------------------------

This is a template file used by CMake to generate the final automation_lua-config.cmake file.
It's a critical component of the CMake package system that enables other projects
to find and use this library via find_package(automation_lua).

When a user calls find_package(automation_lua) in their project, CMake looks for this
generated config file to load the package settings and targets.

Package Generation Process:
1. CMake processes this template during the build phase using the
   configure_package_config_file() function in CMakeLists.txt.
2. The processed file is written to the build directory as automation_lua-config.cmake
3. During installation, the generated file is copied to the installation location

How it works:
1. @PACKAGE_INIT@ - This macro is replaced by CMake with code that handles
   path calculations, making the package relocatable regardless of where
   it's installed.
2. find_dependency(lua) - Ensures that the Lua dependency is found
3. include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/automation_lua-targets.cmake") - Imports the
   exported targets so they can be used in the consuming project.
4. check_required_components() - Verifies that all components requested
   by the user in find_package() are available.
