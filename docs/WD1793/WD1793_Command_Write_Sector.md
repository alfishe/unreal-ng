# WD1793 Command: Write Sector (Type II)

## Overview

Command Code: **`101m SPCE a0`** (e.g., `0xA8` for single sector, side 0, 15ms delay, normal DAM)

The Write Sector command locates a specific sector ID field on the disk and, if found and valid, writes a new data field (including preamble, DAM, data bytes supplied by the host, and CRC) immediately following it. Handshaking with the host for data bytes occurs via the DRQ signal.

## Command Flags (Bits 0-4)

| Bit | Name | Value | Description                                                                                             |

## Execution flow from another angle

Okay, let's detail the "Write Sector" command for a typical Floppy Disk Controller (FDC), again using the WD17xx (like WD1793) or NEC ÂµPD765 as a reference. The process shares similarities with "Read Sector" but has crucial differences, especially regarding data flow and CRC generation.

**Command Parameters (Typically loaded by CPU into FDC registers):**

1.  **Command Code:** Specific byte for "Write Sector".
2.  **Drive Number:** (0-3) Which drive to use.
3.  **Head Number:** (0 or 1) Which side of the disk.
4.  **Track Number:** The desired physical track on the disk (e.g., 0-39, 0-79).
5.  **Sector Number:** The desired logical sector number on that track (e.g., 1-16).
6.  **Data Byte (for Write Track/Format):** Sometimes a fill byte is specified here if the command is "Write Track" (format), but for "Write Sector," the actual data comes from the host.
7.  **(Implicit) Sector Size:** Often derived from a previous "Specify" command or hardwired.
8.  **(For multi-sector writes) Sector Count:** How many sectors to write.
9.  **(Optional) Deleted Data Address Mark (DDAM) flag:** Some FDCs allow writing a sector with a DDAM (e.g., 0xF8) instead of a normal DAM (0xFB) to mark it as deleted or special.

**FDC "Write Sector" Execution Steps:**

The FDC takes over once the command is issued.

**Phase 1: Preparation and Seek (Identical to Read Sector)**

1.  **Drive & Head Select:**
    *   Activates `DS0-DS3`, `SIDE1` as needed.
    *   Issues `HDL` if required, waits for head load delay.
    *   **Track Bytes:** No data writing yet.

2.  **Seek to Target Track (if not already there):**
    *   Compares current track with target track.
    *   **If different:** Issues `DIRC` and `STEP` pulses, waits for "Head Settle Time."
    *   `BUSY` status bit is set.
    *   A "Verify" operation (reading an ID field) might occur. Failure -> **Seek Error**.
    *   **Track Bytes:** No data writing during seek.

**Phase 2: Sector Search (Finding the ID Field - Identical to Read Sector)**

Once the FDC believes it's on the correct physical track and the head is settled:

3.  **Enable Read Circuits & Search for ID Address Mark (IDAM):**
    *   FDC starts reading the MFM data stream.
    *   Looks for Sync Bytes, then the IDAM pattern (e.g., preamble + 0xFE).
    *   **Track Bytes:** Actively processing read stream from the current track.

4.  **Read and Verify ID Field:**
    *   **Upon finding an IDAM:** Reads Track, Head, Sector, Size Code, ID CRC (6 bytes).
    *   **ID CRC Check:** Calculates CRC on (IDAM byte + T + H + S + Size) and compares with disk's ID CRC.
        *   **Error:** -> **CRC Error** (ID CRC). Continues search.
    *   **ID Field Match:** If ID CRC OK, compares disk's T, H, S with commanded T, H, S.
        *   **Track/Head Mismatch:** -> **Seek Error** or re-verify.
        *   **Sector Mismatch:** Ignores this sector, continues search for next IDAM.
        *   **Sector Match:** If T, H, S match and ID CRC OK, the FDC has found the correct sector's ID field. It now knows where to start writing the data field.

5.  **Record Not Found Timeout:**
    *   If a full revolution occurs without finding the matching ID field (with good ID CRC) -> **Record Not Found** (RNF) status, terminates command.
    *   **Track Bytes:** Scanned all ~6250 MFM bytes of the track.

**Phase 3: Data Field Write (This is where it significantly differs from Read Sector)**

Once the correct sector ID is found and verified:

6.  **Switch to Write Mode & Write Gap 2 (Partial):**
    *   The FDC turns on the drive's "Write Gate" signal, enabling the write head.
    *   It might write a few bytes of Gap 2 pattern (e.g., 0x4E MFM encoded) to ensure proper synchronization and to overwrite the old Gap 2 and start of the old data field. This is to establish a clean MFM clocking environment before writing the critical DAM.
    *   **Track Bytes:** FDC *starts writing* MFM patterns to the disk, beginning in what was Gap 2.

7.  **Write Data Sync and Data Address Mark (DAM):**
    *   The FDC writes the **Data Sync** bytes (e.g., 12 bytes of 0x00 MFM encoded).
    *   Then, it writes the **Data Mark Preamble** (e.g., 3 bytes of 0xA1 MFM encoded).
    *   Finally, it writes the **Data Address Mark (DAM)** itself (e.g., 0xFB MFM encoded for normal data, or 0xF8 if commanded for DDAM).
    *   **CRC Accumulator Start:** The FDC internally initializes its data CRC calculation. The **DAM byte (e.g., 0xFB) is the first byte included in the Data CRC calculation.**
    *   **Track Bytes:** Writes the MFM patterns for Sync and DAM.

8.  **Transfer Data from Host & Write Sector Data:**
    *   The FDC now needs data from the host CPU to write into the sector.
    *   **Data Transfer (PIO - Programmed I/O):**
        *   FDC sets the **DRQ (Data Request)** status bit/signal high, indicating it's ready for a byte.
        *   The host CPU writes a byte of data to the FDC's **Data Register**.
        *   DRQ is cleared by the FDC once it takes the byte.
        *   The FDC takes this raw binary byte, **MFM encodes it**, and writes the MFM pattern to the disk.
        *   **CRC Update:** The FDC **includes this raw binary byte in its ongoing Data CRC calculation.**
        *   This repeats for the number of bytes specified by the **Sector Size Code** found in the ID field (e.g., 256 times for code 01).
        *   **Error - Lost Data (Host too slow):** If the FDC is ready to write the next MFM pattern but DRQ is *still* clear (meaning the CPU hasn't provided the next data byte in time), this is a problem. The FDC might write garbage data or abort. The **Lost Data** status bit is often set.
    *   **Data Transfer (DMA - Direct Memory Access):**
        *   FDC signals DMAC via DRQ.
        *   DMAC takes a byte from RAM, writes it to FDC's Data Register.
        *   FDC MFM encodes it, writes to disk, includes in CRC, and requests next byte via DRQ.
    *   **Track Bytes:** The FDC writes [Sector Size] MFM-encoded bytes received from the host.

9.  **Calculate and Write Data CRC:**
    *   After all sector data bytes have been received from the host, MFM encoded, written to disk, and included in the internal CRC calculation:
        *   The FDC has the final 16-bit **Data CRC** value.
        *   It MFM encodes these two CRC bytes.
        *   It writes these two MFM-encoded CRC bytes to the disk immediately following the sector data.
    *   **Track Bytes:** Writes the 2 MFM-encoded CRC bytes.

10. **Write Gap 3 (Partial):**
    *   After writing the Data CRC, the FDC continues to write a few bytes of the Gap 3 pattern (e.g., 0x4E MFM encoded). This ensures the write operation is properly terminated and provides spacing before the next sector's ID field might begin.
    *   The FDC then deactivates the "Write Gate" signal.
    *   **Track Bytes:** Writes a few more MFM gap bytes.

**Phase 4: Command Termination**

11. **Set Final Status & Interrupt:**
    *   The FDC clears its `BUSY` status bit.
    *   It updates its **Status Register**. Notably, there's no "Data CRC Error" bit to set for a *write* operation in the same way as a read, because the FDC *generated* the CRC. However, other errors like RNF, Seek Error, Write Protect, or Lost Data could have occurred.
    *   It generates an **Interrupt Request (IRQ)** signal to the host CPU.
    *   **When it finishes:** The command operation *on the drive* finishes after the trailing gap bytes are written and Write Gate is turned off.

**CRC Forming Differences (Write vs. Read):**

*   **ID Field CRC:**
    *   **Read:** FDC reads IDAM, T, H, S, Size from disk, reads ID CRC from disk. Calculates CRC on (IDAM+T+H+S+Size) and compares.
    *   **Write:** FDC reads IDAM, T, H, S, Size from disk, reads ID CRC from disk. Calculates CRC on (IDAM+T+H+S+Size) and compares. *This part is the same for identifying the sector.* The FDC does *not* write or modify the ID field during a "Write Sector" command (that's done by a "Format Track" or "Write ID" command).
*   **Data Field CRC:**
    *   **Read:** FDC reads DAM and Data from disk, reads Data CRC from disk. Calculates CRC on (DAM+Data) and compares.
    *   **Write:**
        1.  FDC writes the chosen DAM (e.g., 0xFB) to disk.
        2.  FDC **starts a new CRC calculation** internally, seeding it or including the DAM byte.
        3.  For each data byte received from the host:
            *   FDC MFM encodes and writes the byte to disk.
            *   FDC **updates its internal Data CRC calculation** using the *original binary byte* received from the host.
        4.  After all data bytes are processed, the FDC writes its internally calculated 2-byte Data CRC (MFM encoded) to the disk.

**Common Status Register Bits (e.g., WD1793 - relevant to Write):**

*   **Bit 7 - Not Ready:** Drive not ready. Command aborts.
*   **Bit 6 - Write Protect:** Attempted to write to a write-protected disk. Command aborts, this bit is set.
*   **Bit 5 - Head Loaded / (Type I: Record Type/DDAM):** Head loaded. (This bit might reflect if DDAM was *written* if the FDC has that feedback, but usually, it's more about what was *found* during a read).
*   **Bit 4 - Seek Error / (Type I: Record Not Found):** Seek failed, or target sector ID not found.
*   **Bit 3 - CRC Error:** *During the ID field search phase*, an ID CRC error was detected. (Not applicable to the data field being written, as the FDC generates that CRC).
*   **Bit 2 - Lost Data / (Track 0 for Seek):** CPU didn't supply data byte to FDC via DRQ in time during the data writing phase.
*   **Bit 1 - DRQ (Data Request):**
    *   Write Sector: FDC is ready for the CPU to write the *next* data byte to its Data Register.
*   **Bit 0 - BUSY:** FDC is currently executing a command.

**Summary of "Track Byte" Interaction for Writing:**

*   **Seek Phase:** No track byte writing.
*   **ID Search Phase (Read):** FDC reads MFM stream to find IDAM, reads ID field (T, H, S, Size, ID CRC).
*   **Write Starts:** After ID field is found and Gap 2 begins, FDC turns on Write Gate.
*   **Write Gap 2 (partial), Data Sync, DAM:** FDC writes these MFM patterns.
*   **Write Sector Data:** FDC receives [Sector Size] bytes from host, MFM encodes each, and writes them.
*   **Write Data CRC:** FDC writes its internally calculated 2-byte Data CRC (MFM encoded).
*   **Write Gap 3 (partial):** FDC writes a few more MFM gap bytes.
*   **Write Ends (drive interaction):** After trailing gap and Write Gate is turned off.

The "Write Sector" command is a delicate dance of first finding the right spot by reading, then precisely switching to writing the new data field content along with a freshly calculated CRC.


## Execution Flow

1.  **Initiation:**
    *   Host CPU pre-loads the **Sector Register** with the target sector number.
    *   Host writes the Write Sector command byte to the Command Register.
    *   Controller samples **/READY** input. If inactive, sets **NOT READY** (S7) and terminates.
    *   Controller samples **/WPRT** (Write Protect) input. If active (low), sets **WRITE PROTECT** (S6) and terminates.
    *   If ready and not protected, controller sets **BUSY** (S0=1).
    *   Asserts `HLD` (Head Load) output.
    *   If `E=1`, waits 15ms/30ms settling delay.
    *   Waits for `HLT` (Head Load Timing) input to go high. Times out if HLT remains low.

2.  **ID Field Search & Validation:**
    *   Controller scans the incoming raw data stream for an ID Address Mark (IDAM).
    *   Upon finding an IDAM, reads the ID field contents (Track, Side, Sector, Length, CRC).
    *   **Validation Checks:**
        *   Compares Track Number with internal **Track Register**.
        *   If `C=1`, compares Side Number with command flag `S`.
        *   Compares Sector Number with internal **Sector Register**.
        *   Calculates and verifies the ID field's CRC.
    *   **Mismatch/Error:** If any comparison fails or ID CRC is bad:
        *   If CRC error, sets **CRC ERROR** (S3) temporarily.
        *   Continues searching for the next IDAM.
    *   **Timeout:** If a matching, valid ID field is not found within 5 index pulses (revolutions), sets **RECORD NOT FOUND** (S4) and terminates.

3.  **First DRQ (Data Request) & Write Gate Precondition:**
    *   After finding a valid, matching ID field, the controller waits for a specific gap time (sync gap). In MFM, this is nominally 22 byte times after the ID CRC; in FM, 11 byte times.
    *   At the end of this gap time, the controller asserts **DRQ** (Data Request signal and Status Bit 1), demanding the *first* data byte from the host.
    *   **Critical Timing:** The host *must* write the first data byte to the controller's **Data Register** before the physical position for the start of the data field preamble passes under the head. This deadline is crucial.
    *   **Write Gate Interlock:** The `WG` (Write Gate) output signal, which enables write current in the drive, will *only* be asserted if this first DRQ is serviced by the host in time.

4.  **Write Operation (If first DRQ serviced):**
    *   **Write Gate Activation:** Controller asserts `WG` output.
    *   **Preamble Writing:** Controller writes a sync preamble to the disk (typically 12 bytes of `0x00` in MFM, 6 bytes in FM).
    *   **Data Address Mark (DAM):** Controller writes the DAM (`0xFB` or `0xF8` based on command flag `a0`) along with its unique clock pattern (`A1*` precursor in MFM).
    *   **Data Transfer Loop:** For each subsequent byte of the data field (up to the length specified in the preceding ID field):
        *   Controller asserts **DRQ** (signal and Status Bit 1), requesting the next byte.
        *   **Host Action:** Host must write the byte to the **Data Register** within the per-byte time limit (~32Âµs in MFM, ~64Âµs in FM).
        *   **Lost Data:** If the host fails to service DRQ in time:
            *   Controller sets **LOST DATA** (S2).
            *   Controller writes a byte of `0x00` to the disk instead of the intended data.
            *   *Crucially, the write operation continues*, potentially corrupting the rest of the sector.
        *   Controller writes the (received or `0x00`) byte to the disk.
    *   **CRC Writing:** After the last data byte is written, the controller calculates the 2-byte Data Field CRC and writes it to the disk.
    *   **Postamble:** Controller writes a postamble byte (typically `0xFF` in MFM).
    *   **Write Gate Deactivation:** Controller deactivates `WG` output.

5.  **Command Termination (If first DRQ *not* serviced):**
    *   If the host fails to provide the *first* data byte after the initial DRQ assertion (Step 3):
    *   Controller does *not* assert `WG`. No data is written to the disk.
    *   Controller sets **LOST DATA** (S2).
    *   Command terminates immediately.
    *   Controller clears **BUSY** (S0).
    *   Asserts **/INTRQ**.
    *   Updates Status Register.

6.  **Completion / Multi-Sector Handling (after successful write):**
    *   **Single Sector (`m=0`):**
        *   Command terminates.
        *   Controller clears **BUSY** (S0).
        *   Asserts **/INTRQ**.
        *   Updates Status Register (S0-S7).
    *   **Multiple Sector (`m=1`):**
        *   Controller increments its internal **Sector Register**.
        *   If the Sector Register exceeds the limit, sets **RECORD NOT FOUND** (S4) and terminates.
        *   Otherwise, loops back to Step 2 (ID Field Search) for the *next* sector.
        *   The command only terminates when:
            *   An error occurs (RNF, CRC Error, Lost Data, Write Protect).
            *   The Sector Register wraps/reaches limit.
            *   A **Force Interrupt** (Type IV) command is received.

## Status Register (Write Sector Completion)

| Bit | Name            | Meaning After Write Sector Command                                     |
| :-: | :-------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7   | NOT READY       | Drive not ready (/READY high or MR active).                            |
| 6   | WRITE PROTECT   | Disk write protected (/WPRT low) - checked at command start.          |
| 5   | WRITE FAULT     | Optional drive fault signal (/WF input low) detected during write.     |
| 4   | RECORD NOT FOUND| Matching ID field not found within timeout.                           |
| 3   | CRC ERROR       | CRC error encountered in the ID field search.                         |
| 2   | LOST DATA       | Host failed to provide data byte (first or subsequent) via DRQ in time. |
| 1   | DRQ             | 0 (Controller does not need data currently).                         |
| 0   | BUSY            | 0 (Command completed).                                                |

## Emulation Considerations

*   Requires write capability to the disk image representation.
*   Simulate ID field search and validation as in Read Sector.
*   Model the 22/11 byte gap timing after ID CRC.
*   Implement the DRQ logic for the *first* byte carefully â this gates the entire write operation (`WG`).
*   Model the per-byte DRQ timing (~32/64Âµs).
*   If the host emulator writes to the Data Register too late:
    *   Set the LOST DATA flag.
    *   If it was the *first* DRQ, abort the write entirely.
    *   If it was a subsequent DRQ, write `0x00` to the image and continue.
*   Simulate writing the preamble, DAM, data bytes, calculated CRC, and postamble to the image.
*   Handle multi-sector logic (`m=1`) by incrementing the Sector Register and looping.
*   Accurately update all status bits, paying close attention to how LOST DATA affects the outcome.
*   Monitor the /WPRT input state at the start. Monitor /WF input during the `WG`-active phase.
